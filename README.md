# GAN-Facial-Super-Resolution-System-PULSE
Creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Facial Super Resolution like PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration) involves utilizing the framework of GANs to enhance the resolution of images, particularly facial images. PULSE, developed by researchers at UC Berkeley, uses a novel technique where the latent space of a generative model is explored in a way to generate super-resolved high-quality images from low-quality inputs.

Below is an outline and simplified code that demonstrates the key components of building such a system, although please note that the full version of PULSE involves advanced techniques, and it's a very specialized research paper. The full PULSE system involves training a large-scale GAN model and using deep latent space exploration for image upsampling.
Key Concepts in GAN-based Facial Super-Resolution:

    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
        Generator: Takes in random noise and generates images.
        Discriminator: Tries to differentiate between generated images and real images.

    Super-Resolution:
        The goal is to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. For facial images, this typically involves increasing the resolution of an image without losing important facial details.

Pseudo Code for Building a GAN-Based Super-Resolution Model:

    Data Preparation:
        You need a high-quality dataset of facial images, typically from sources like CelebA or FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset).
        The images are then downsampled to create low-resolution (LR) versions for training.

    Model Design:
        The model consists of a generator that maps from a latent vector to a high-resolution facial image, and a discriminator that differentiates real high-resolution images from generated ones.

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of what the code might look like using TensorFlow/Keras (for GAN framework):
Step 1: Setup and Dependencies

pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gan opencv-python matplotlib

Step 2: Define Generator and Discriminator Models

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_generator(latent_dim):
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Dense(128, input_dim=latent_dim))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Reshape((1, 1, 128)))
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(128, kernel_size=4, strides=2, padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, kernel_size=4, strides=2, padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(32, kernel_size=4, strides=2, padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(3, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='tanh'))
    return model

def build_discriminator(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.InputLayer(input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(128, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    return model

Step 3: Define the GAN Model

def build_gan(generator, discriminator):
    discriminator.trainable = False
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(generator)
    model.add(discriminator)
    return model

Step 4: Compile Models and Training Loop

def compile_models(generator, discriminator, gan):
    # Compile Discriminator
    discriminator.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    # Compile GAN (generator + discriminator)
    gan.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

def train_gan(generator, discriminator, gan, X_train, epochs, batch_size, latent_dim):
    half_batch = batch_size // 2

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Train discriminator with real and fake images
        idx = np.random.randint(0, X_train.shape[0], half_batch)
        real_images = X_train[idx]
        fake_images = generator.predict(np.random.normal(0, 1, (half_batch, latent_dim)))

        d_loss_real = discriminator.train_on_batch(real_images, np.ones((half_batch, 1)))
        d_loss_fake = discriminator.train_on_batch(fake_images, np.zeros((half_batch, 1)))
        d_loss = 0.5 * np.add(d_loss_real, d_loss_fake)

        # Train generator
        noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, (batch_size, latent_dim))
        g_loss = gan.train_on_batch(noise, np.ones((batch_size, 1)))

        # Print the progress
        print(f"{epoch}/{epochs} [D loss: {d_loss[0]} | D accuracy: {100 * d_loss[1]}] [G loss: {g_loss}]")

Step 5: Data Preparation

For super-resolution, you would typically use high-resolution (HR) images of faces and create low-resolution (LR) versions to train your GAN model. A simple approach would be:

import numpy as np
import cv2

def preprocess_data(image_paths, downscale_factor=4):
    high_res_images = []
    low_res_images = []

    for img_path in image_paths:
        img = cv2.imread(img_path)
        img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))  # Resize to fixed size (128x128)
        hr_img = img / 127.5 - 1.0  # Normalize to [-1, 1]

        # Downscale the image to generate low-res versions
        lr_img = cv2.resize(hr_img, (int(128 / downscale_factor), int(128 / downscale_factor)))
        lr_img = cv2.resize(lr_img, (128, 128))  # Upscale back to 128x128 for input

        high_res_images.append(hr_img)
        low_res_images.append(lr_img)

    return np.array(low_res_images), np.array(high_res_images)

Step 6: Training the Model

Finally, you can use the following code to train the GAN for facial super-resolution:

# Load your dataset
image_paths = ["path/to/your/images/*.jpg"]
X_train_lr, X_train_hr = preprocess_data(image_paths)

latent_dim = 100  # Latent dimension for the generator
input_shape = (128, 128, 3)

generator = build_generator(latent_dim)
discriminator = build_discriminator(input_shape)
gan = build_gan(generator, discriminator)

compile_models(generator, discriminator, gan)

train_gan(generator, discriminator, gan, X_train_hr, epochs=10000, batch_size=64, latent_dim=latent_dim)

Final Thoughts:

    PULSE works by generating images from a latent space, and while the above code uses a basic GAN approach, more advanced techniques (e.g., perceptual loss, feature matching, and latent space optimization) would be required to mimic the performance of the full PULSE model.
    Training the GAN: Super-resolution GANs require substantial training time and high-quality datasets, especially when working with complex datasets like facial images. A high-performance GPU is essential for training such models.
    Improving Results: You could enhance the output by integrating advanced loss functions (e.g., perceptual loss, content loss, etc.), employing more advanced GAN variants (e.g., Wasserstein GANs), and using pre-trained models as starting points.

In summary, while the full implementation of PULSE is more sophisticated, this code gives a basic foundation for creating a GAN-based facial super-resolution model.
